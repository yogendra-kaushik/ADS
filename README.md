This project uses [Yarn](yarnpkg.com) instead of npm to provide a more reliable development experience over traditional NPM

* `npm install -g angular-cli` 
* `npm install -g yarn`
* `yarn install`


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
